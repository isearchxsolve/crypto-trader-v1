- **Action:** Executed code modifications to server/routes.ts based on MASTER_BLUEPRINT.
- **Details:** Found that F-1, F-7, and F-9 were already verified and fixed (lamports using Math.round, background position exiting, and blended paper PnL). For S-4, converted storage.updateBotStats to wait to prevent async state divergence. Fixed syntax error missing sync on lambda. For S-5, added transactional memory integrity recovery logic by initializing peakPrices dynamically from DB in checkOpenPositions if missing.
- **Result:** Successfully modified pipeline. 
px tsc --noEmit compiled successfully with 0 errors.
